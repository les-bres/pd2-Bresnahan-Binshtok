Game of Life

Group Members: Leslie Bresnahan & Matthew Binshtok

Project Description: An online version of the classic board game, The Game of life. You start out by deciding whether you want to go to college or not, and then face expenses and rewards as well as launch a career, adopt a pet, and buy a house.

Instructions:
Go into the Life folder, compile all .java files, open Life.pde, and press play.  All of the instructions are on the left hand side bar in the black box. If the instructions give you numerical values as answers, use your keyboard.  Otherwise just use the yes and no buttons directly below it.  Continue to play until you hit retirement at the end of the board.

What Works/ Doesn't work:
Everything should work, but the game's response to button usage is very slow so sometimes you need to click twice.

Data Structures:
After setting up our board in a 2D array, we gave it single linked list functionality so that to move a player forwards we could easily call getNext(). We also used maze solving recursion to generate the linked list based on the 2D array.
