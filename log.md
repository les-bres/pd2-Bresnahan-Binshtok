6/2/14- Leslie- created repository & set up general guidelines & readme
6/5/14- Leslie- Brainstorming & planning
6/6/14- Leslie- Experimentation with processing to figure out basic functionality
6/8/14- Leslie- More experimentation, this time with objects
6/9/14- Leslie- Started to contruct board w/ array list
6/10/14- Leslie- Finished board array contruction
	 Leslie- Created classes for the following cards: Career, House, Salary, Stock, Tile
6/12/14- Leslie- removed experimental files
	 	-created player class complete with variables for various attributes
                -set up pde file with tentative board setup
6/13/14- Leslie- refined board setup with for-loops
	       - Set up background/ window with image
	       - color sidebars with gradient
6/15/14- Leslie- further condensed board contruction
	       -separated board instantiation from sketch
	       -fixed coloring and stroke issues
	       -created yes and no buttons w/ mouse interaction
	       -created window for viewing current text
               -curved board corners by idicating with an extra digit in the 2D what corner (if any) was curved
	       -changed board instantiation to accomodate curves by using % and /
	       -initialized start-up questions for player interacting w/ buttons & keyboard
	       -added linked list functionality to board by using maze solver recursion
6/16/14- Leslie -new Card classes:Expense, Pet, Raffle
		-set up card class to hold the various types and initiated the diff cards w/ diff messages
		-update player class and implement various instances of the cards
		-fixed white space problem with board
		-remove mouse functionality from spinner bc problems
		-wrote algorithm to color diff spaces on board based on square type & assign types based on frequency in immediate proximity
		-add money display on the side
		-incorporate spin into turn method & implement turn so that it displays questions and acts according to square type
		-changed card data structure from array to arraylist
		-added car functionality that you see yourself moving through board
		-fixed null pointer exceptions from wonky implementation of card classes
		-implement ending with booleans
		-fixed cars so that diff colors possible
